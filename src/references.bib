  abstract     = {We present a strikingly simple proof that two rules are sufficient to automate gradient descent: 1) don't increase the stepsize too fast and 2) don't overstep the local curvature. No need for functional values, no line search, no information about the function except for the gradients. By following these rules, you get a method adaptive to the local geometry, with convergence guarantees depending only on the smoothness in a neighborhood of a solution. Given that the problem is convex, our method converges even if the global smoothness constant is infinity. As an illustration, it can minimize arbitrary continuously twice-differentiable convex function. We examine its performance on a range of convex and nonconvex problems, including logistic regression and matrix factorization.},

Construction of these regions is based on efficient semidefinite programming techniques accelerated via sparsity exploiting algorithms. Resulting regions have a simple geometric shape in the space of power injections (polytope or ellipsoid) and can be efficiently used for assessment of system security in the presence of uncertainty. Efficiency and tightness of the approach is validated on a number of test networks.},

  abstract    = {We present a systematic comparison between neural network (NN) architectures for inference of AC-OPF solutions. Using fully connected NNs as a baseline we demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging network topology in the models by constructing abstract representations of electrical grids in the graph domain, for both convolutional and graph NNs. The performance of the NN architectures is compared for regression (predicting optimal generator set-points) and classification (predicting the active set of constraints) settings. Computational gains for obtaining optimal solutions are also presented.},
