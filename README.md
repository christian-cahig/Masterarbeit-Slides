# *Anticipatory Power Flow: Formulation, Computation, and Applications*

This repository houses the LaTeX source code for the presentation slides
used during the final defense of my master's thesis
([*A Computational Approach to Anticipating Supply Injections and Bus Voltages in Steady-State Power Systems Analysis*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7180586)).

## Organization

The LaTeX project is housed at `src`.
The root file is `src/main.tex`, which should generate `src/main.pdf` after compilation.
This has been tested only on TeX Live version 2022 on Windows 10.
